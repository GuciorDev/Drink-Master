# Drink-Master

The "DrinkMaster App" is a web application that allows users to create and customize their own virtual drinks by adding different layers of alcoholic beverages and chasers. The app provides a visual representation of the drink in a glass container. Users can select from various types of alcohol such as vodka, rum, gin, tequila, and whiskey, and add them to the glass by clicking on the corresponding buttons. Each layer of alcohol is represented by a different color.

Additionally, users can choose to add a chaser to their drink by selecting from options like coke, juice, or water. Depending on the selected chaser, additional dropdown menus appear for selecting specific types of juice or coke. When a chaser is added, it appears as a new layer in the glass.

The app also provides the functionality to delete the topmost layer of the drink by clicking on the "Delete Drink" button. A popup window appears when the user clicks on the "Add %" button, allowing them to specify the brand and amount of the selected alcohol to be added as a new layer. The user can input the desired amount within a range of 5 mL to 250 mL.

The DrinkMaster App utilizes the Bootstrap CSS framework for styling and layout, and it relies on Bootstrap's JavaScript and jQuery libraries for interactive elements and dynamic behavior.

How to Use
Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.
The DrinkMaster App will load, displaying an empty glass container on the left and a selection of alcohol buttons on the right.
To add a layer of alcohol to the drink, click on one of the alcohol buttons (e.g., Vodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila, Whiskey). Each alcohol type is represented by a different color.
A new layer will be added to the glass, displaying the selected alcohol type and a popup window for customizing the layer.
In the popup window, select a brand from the dropdown menu and specify the desired amount of alcohol to be added (between 5 mL and 250 mL).
Click the "Add Layer" button to confirm the selection. The layer will be added to the drink, and the popup window will close.
Repeat steps 3-6 to add additional layers of alcohol to the drink.
To add a chaser to the drink, select one of the chaser options (Coke, Juice, Water) from the "Add Chaser" dropdown menu.
Depending on the selected chaser, additional dropdown menus may appear for choosing specific types of juice or coke.
Select the desired chaser and type, and a new layer representing the chaser will be added to the drink.
To delete the topmost layer of the drink, click the "Delete Drink" button.
Continue experimenting with different combinations of alcohol and chasers to create unique drinks.

Customization
If you want to customize the DrinkMaster App, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code within the provided "index.html" file. The styles and layout are defined in the <style> tag in the HTML's <head> section, while the interactive behavior is implemented using JavaScript in the <script> tag before the closing </body> tag.

Feel free to make changes to the code, experiment with different styles, or extend the functionality according to your requirements.

Limitations
The DrinkMaster App is a simple demonstration of creating virtual drinks and does not have any backend or server-side functionality. It is purely a frontend application and does not save or persist any data. Reloading the page will reset the drink and remove all layers.

Happy mixing and enjoy responsibly!

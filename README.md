# Drink-Master

The DrinkMaster App is a web application that enables users to create and customize virtual drinks by adding layers of different alcoholic beverages and chasers. The app provides a visual representation of the drink in a glass container, allowing users to experiment with various combinations and proportions.

How to Use
Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.
The DrinkMaster App will load, displaying an empty glass container on the left and a selection of alcohol buttons on the right.
To add a layer of alcohol to the drink, click on one of the alcohol buttons (e.g., Vodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila, Whiskey). Each alcohol type is represented by a different color.
A new layer will be added to the glass, displaying the selected alcohol type and a popup window for customizing the layer.
In the popup window, select a brand from the dropdown menu and specify the desired amount of alcohol to be added (between 5 mL and 250 mL).
Click the "Add Layer" button to confirm the selection. The layer will be added to the drink, and the popup window will close.
Repeat steps 3-6 to add additional layers of alcohol to the drink.
To add a chaser to the drink, select one of the chaser options (Coke, Juice, Water) from the "Add Chaser" dropdown menu.
Depending on the selected chaser, additional dropdown menus may appear for choosing specific types of juice or coke.
Select the desired chaser and type, and a new layer representing the chaser will be added to the drink.
To delete the topmost layer of the drink, click the "Delete Drink" button.
Continue experimenting with different combinations of alcohol and chasers to create unique drinks.
Dependencies
The DrinkMaster App relies on the following external dependencies:

Bootstrap CSS (version 4.5.0): Provides the base styling and layout of the application.
jQuery (version 3.5.1 slim): Enables interactive elements and dynamic behavior within the app.
Bootstrap JS Bundle (version 4.5.0): Includes Bootstrap's JavaScript components for enhanced functionality.
These dependencies are included in the HTML file via CDN links and do not require manual installation.

Customization
If you want to customize the DrinkMaster App, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code within the provided "index.html" file. The styles and layout are defined in the <style> tag in the HTML's <head> section, while the interactive behavior is implemented using JavaScript in the <script> tag before the closing </body> tag.

Feel free to make changes to the code, experiment with different styles, or extend the functionality according to your requirements.

Limitations
The DrinkMaster App is a simple demonstration of creating virtual drinks and does not have any backend or server-side functionality. It is purely a frontend application and does not save or persist any data. Reloading the page will reset the drink and remove all layers.

Happy mixing and enjoy responsibly!
